# My_Coding_Journey
As Saron of Codenewbie might say: "this is where I will share my coding journey, in the hopes of helping others on theirs." At the moment, I'm afraid that it is just a storage space for some of the programs I have written, but I will provide more detailed information in time, including what courses I have followed, podcasts listened to and blogs and books I have read. So, watch this space!
